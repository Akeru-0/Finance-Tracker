## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition or higher)
- .NET 6.0 SDK

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akeru-0/Finance-Tracker
```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
```bash
cd finance-tracker
start FinanceTracker.sln
```


3. Restore NuGet packages
```bash
dotnet restore
```

4. Build and run the application
```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run --project FinanceTracker
```

The application will create a SQLite database file (FinanceTracker.db) when first launched. It comes pre-seeded with sample transactions to demonstrate the app's features, including:
- Monthly salary (recurring income)
- Rent payment (recurring expense)
- Grocery shopping
- Transportation expenses
- Freelance income

These sample transactions help visualize the charts and demonstrate the app's functionality. You can delete them and add your own transactions as needed.

Note: The database file is excluded from source control (via .gitignore) to keep your financial data private.
